# TrailSporks

An app that looks to disrupt the trail mapping space. We are looking to fundamentally change the way people give their data to companies that then use that data to run targeted ads for vacations to Saudi Arabia. We plan to do this by synergizing and reimagining everything from user experience and backend design (Mostly because we don't know how this works in the first place). 

Series A Funding: $4.20 that we found in our couches.
